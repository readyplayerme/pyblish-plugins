    By embedding images inside the blend-file, it's not guaranteed that the texture maps get updated once the external
    file is updated. This can lead to outdated texture maps in the blend-file.
    Embedding also increases storage needs by saving redundant information.
    You can disable auto-embedding in Blender by deactivating:
